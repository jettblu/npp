              I graduated from the Pig Iron School / University of the Arts in
              Philadelphia with an MFA in Devised Performance. Before that, I
              was a Latin and Greek teacher with an undergraduate degree in
              Classical Philology from Harvard University. I have performed,
              directed, and coached improv comedy since 2013.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have performed at improv festivals in the US and Canada. I
              performed weekly improv comedy shows in Philadelphia for six
              years, mostly with the teams The Future and Dream Tank. I taught
              improv at the Philly Improv Theater to beginners looking to expand
              their horizons and advanced improvisers looking to hone their
              craft.

              I was once paid to recite Duchamp’s manifesto in a men’s bathroom
              at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
