      "How I met improv? Gosh, let me see... it was Fall of 2022 when Call Your Ma (the annual subtroupe collab show) auditions opened. I marked that I was willing to do both acting and improv and had no idea what I was getting into. But in the audition room, improv and I just locked eyes (Stoppp I'm not blushing!). \n I was fumbling, no idea what was coming out of my mouth, but improv listened to my ideas patiently and inspired me to push my limits. When I performed with the rest of cast, improv held my hand and gave me courage. \n I looked for ways to get to know him better and started to go to Workshops. There were some embarrassing moments, but hey, we were embarrassing together. \n I took a chance by auditioning for NPP troupe, and improv took a chance on me. And we've been happy together ever since",
