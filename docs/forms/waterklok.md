**Time:** 30-40 minutes

**Type:** It's Own Thing

**Setup:** None

**WOS:** Word

**Idea Generation / Prep:** None

**Form:** 

- Starts at highest stakes possible, referencing things that happened in the past that we haven’t seen
- Someone off shouts “ZERF” and the characters freeze. Come on and either tap or wipe the scene to see the scene before that (so you got to C -> A)
- Rinse and repeat until someone shouts “FREEZE”. Characters freeze and there is a wipe or tap, but now in a forward moving parallel universe
