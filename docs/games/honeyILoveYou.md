Have one person start by being ‘it’. The ‘it’ person enters the center of the circle and starts walking up to other players and tries to get them to smile or laugh by saying “Honey I love you, won’t you please just smile or please smile for me?”

They may do this by using different inflections, movements, gestures, and faces, but they may not touch the other person. The person must respond by saying “Honey, I love you, but I just can’t smile.”

If they crack before the ‘it’ person asks the question to someone else, then they become ‘it’.
