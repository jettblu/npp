Moderator in the middle, everyone in a circle.
Introduce moves in phases.

## Actions

**Bippity bippity bop:** Moderator points at someone and says “Bippity bippity bop”. They have to say “Bop” before the moderator does, or they’re out.

**Bop:** Moderator points at someone and says “Bop.” They have to stay still. If they move or say something, they’re out!

**Bang:** Moderator points finger gun at someone and says “Bang.” They have to crouch down. The two people on their sides put their arm facing that person out into a finger gun and say “Bang.”

- If the person in the middle doesn’t go down, they are out.
- If one of the side people shoots late, they are out.
- If someone not in the three shoots, they have banged an innocent and are out.
- As more people go out, side people should keep shooting in line with the circle, not directly towards each other, as their bullets curve through the circle.

## Group Poses

Group poses require multiple people to perform an action. If everyone gets into formation before the countdown they are good, otherwise the person/people who couldn’t are out.

**Elephant:** Moderator points at someone, says “Elephant. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.” They have to make an elephant trunk by holding their nose with one hand, extending their other arm through the first arm, and making trunk motions. Imaginary bonus points if they can make elephant noises.
The two people on their side put their outer arms to their ears and make the elephant’s ears.
If everyone gets into formation before the countdown they are good, otherwise the person/people who couldn’t are out.

**Airplane:** Moderator points at someone, says “Airplane. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.” They have to make pilot’s googles by making two circles with their thumb and index finger, and putting them up to their eyes, but with their hands turned over so their palms are towards their face.
The two people on their side put their outer arms out at an angle upwards and make wings.
If everyone gets into formation before the countdown they are good, otherwise the person/people who couldn’t are out.

**Jello:** Moderator points at someone, says “Jello. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.” They have to put their arms up and wiggle, going “Watch me wiggle!”.
The two people on their side put their arms out in a horizontal semicircle, making the container the jello is in. They also wiggle their arms, as the container is also made of jello.
If everyone gets into formation before the countdown they are good, otherwise the person/people who couldn’t are out.

**Cat in a Washer:** Moderator points at someone, says “Cat in a washer. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.” They have to make kitty paws with their arms, and turn around while doing a cat screech.
The two people on their side put their arms out in a vertical semicircle, making the window of the washer.

## Rules

1. When someone is out, they sit in place
2. When all but two people are out, they stand back to back in the middle. Then the moderator asks for a word. The moderator will say words that rhyme with that word, and for each word, both people will take a step away from each other.
3. When the moderator says the original word, both people stop, take a deep breath, turn around, and start shooting at each other going “Bang bang bang bang…” People on the sidelines will give them a beat that gets faster and faster. The first person that runs out of breath dies a dramatic death and the other is the winner.
