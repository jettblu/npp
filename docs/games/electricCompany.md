In a circle, everyone keeps a beat on their thighs. Person A says a word, then the next person (person B) will say a word. Then everyone repeats those two words then says _de doo de doo_. Person B will then say another word for person C to follow.

### Example

- **Person A:** Electric
- **Person B:** Company
- **Everyone:** Electric Company de doo de doo!
- **Person B:** Crab
- **Person C:** Cakes
- **Everyone:** Crab Cakes de doo de doo

And so on...
